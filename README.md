# customer_segmentation_with_KMeans
This tutorial is meant as introduction (hence it was kept simple) to show possibilities that comes with customer behavior clustering and segmentation using ML like KMeans. 

We'll first do some **manual clustering** and then progress to use machine learning (unsupervised) to perform simple clustering.

**Datacamp** has customer segmentation course which goes through these ideas in more depth - highly recommended
